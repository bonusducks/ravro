# ravro
Implementation of Avro data serialization (http://avro.apache.org) in Rust

# Goals
The primary goal of this project is to provide an implementation of the Avro data serialization system for storing and retriving data from files using [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) as the implementation language. At the moment, I'm not particularly interested in implementing the RPC part of the spec. I may get to it, I may not.
